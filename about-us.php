<h1>About CouZoo</h1>

<p>

Hi there.
</p><p>
If you’ve looked around CouZoo already you may or may not have noticed it’s basically a big, searchable database of local coupons for sale. Think of it kind of like a Netflix or Craigslist for coupons. Just to reiterate, we sell coupons, not deals.
</p><p>
<img src="http://www.halloweenmart.com/media/core/nt/t_MUS41300_GIRAFFE.png" align="right"/>
We started CouZoo for a number of reasons. It started out as only a few but the reasons grew and grew as time went on. Like a lot of people were, we were using daily deal sites and the more we used them the more we found problems with them. Mainly, as customers we wanted three changes - more choices, less up-front investment and NO MORE EMAILS! So we started doing some research and we found out an even bigger issue. With your typical daily deal sites, the merchants were getting screwed. They were typically only earning about 25% of their retail value on the deals they ran. They were often not getting reimbursed this small amount for months at a time. They didn’t have very much control over any part of their deals and they were getting very little feedback from the daily deal companies after their deal had run.  
</p><p>
It just didn’t seem fair to anyone and if it was fair it could certainly be done better. So we made it all better. 
</p><p>
As a customer we will let everyone see every coupon we have available, not just one, or 10, or 20, all of them and we hope to have a lot. You don’t need to worry about investing $20, $40 or more on a deal you never use. At CouZoo you will never pay more than $5 for a coupon and most are just $1 or $2. You can save even more and subscribe to unlimited coupons for only $9 a month. As far as those annoying emails that have taken over everyone’s inbox…or now junk-mail box, the only time you will ever get an email from CouZoo is to confirm something you’ve done or inform you of an important change to the site. 
</p><p>
As a merchant the biggest thing is you will be collecting 100% of the money you earn from your coupon and you get it directly from the customer. CouZoo doesn’t take a cut, not per sale, not before the sale, not after the sale, not a penny. You will also have total control over your coupon. You can use your pictures, use your company description, set your dates, and you can even set sales limits to protect you from over selling and hurting your business. You also get to do this at your leisure with no pushy sales people telling you what’s best for your business. Once your coupon has finished its run on CouZoo your not forgotten. You can view statistics on your coupon sales, who used them, when, where they were form and more. Plus you can even send your customer’s follow-up offers to and feedback surveys. We know our success is based on the happiness of our customers and our customers are your customers so we really want your customers happy and they wont be happy if you’re not happy so guess what? We really, really want you happy.
